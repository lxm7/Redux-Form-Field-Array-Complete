# redux-form-reluxe

This is an accumulation of several new features/technologies I've put together to create an editable form, built on top of redux-form:

Features included from redux-form are:
reinitialisation,
ImmutableJS support,
field arrays and validation.

Also included:
MaterialUI
Google map API for address look up (with auto populating lat/lngs and id generator)
FileReader API for pure View layer file uploading and processing (CSV)
Redux Saga to mimic initial load of data from server. Localstorage used to save progress.

`npm i`

`npm run start`
